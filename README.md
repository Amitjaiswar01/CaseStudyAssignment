•	Start simple: “We built a system to compare two CSV files and report differences.”
•	Explain the flow: “First, we read the files into memory as structured records. Then we compare them using rules defined in a configuration object. Finally, we produce a result object that lists missing records and mismatches.”
•	Highlight strengths: “It’s efficient for large files, flexible for future customization, and fully tested with NUnit.”
•	Give an example: “If Expected has ID=001625, Name=BAII, SCOPE=533.57 and Actual has SCOPE=533.97, the tool reports a field mismatch for SCOPE.”
